# GBF Timers V2

## Data Protection
### Due to this version being free for public use rather than closed access compared to V1, data protection is very important.

Your data will be closed and inaccessible by anyone, the data is updated using a computer and there is no manual work this means that no human will be in-between you and your data.
You can request data deletion and that process will also be automatically done using a computer to ensure no human can view your data.

Your data is encrpyted using AES256-CBC [256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode], this protects your data by encrypting your data from the client to the secure database, TDE is also supported.

## New Features

This was done by greatly improving the code and general connections to the server.
